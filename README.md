## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview: NeuroSplice

**NeuroSplice** is a synthetic biology project focused on developing a **low-cost, paper-based diagnostic platform** for neurological diseases such as **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**.

Our system utilizes **toehold switches** within a **cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system** to specifically detect disease-associated RNA splicing variants (e.g., the **IL7R exon 6 skip**).  
The goal is to provide a **highly specific, accessible, and contained diagnostic tool** that eliminates the need for complex lab infrastructure.

## âœ¨ Key Features of the Wiki

The wiki is designed as a single-page, fully responsive site with modern web features:

- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for mobile and desktop.
- **Sticky Navigation**: Includes a scroll-progress bar for easier reading.
- **Tabbed Sections**: Organized tabs for **Project**, **Wet Lab**, and **Human Practices**.
- **Interactive DBTL Loop**: A dedicated section demonstrating the **Design-Build-Test-Learn** cycle with a liquid-filling pipette animation tied to scroll position.
- **Styling**: Custom design based on **UC Berkeley** and **UCSF** colors, implemented with **Tailwind CSS**.
